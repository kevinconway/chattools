chattools
=========

*Demo tools for extracting metadata from chat lines.*

Example Usage
=============

Emoticons
---------

.. code-block:: python

    from chattools import emoticon
    print(tuple(emoticon.emoticons('Some message with (emoticons) here.')))

HREFs
-----

.. code-block:: python

    from chattools import href
    urls = tuple(href.hrefs('Some message with https://sites.com in it.'))
    titles = tuple(href.titles(urls))
    print(zip(urls, titles))

@Mentions
---------

.. code-block:: python

    from chattools import mention
    print(tuple(mention.mentions('Some message with @mentions in it.')))

Metadata
--------

.. code-block:: python

    from chattools import metadata
    meta = metadata.Metadata('Some message.')
    print(tuple(meta.mentions))
    print(tuple(meta.links))
    print(tuple(meta.emoticons))
    print(meta.json)

Testing
=======

All tests are organized in the 'tests' subdirectory. The layout of the test
modules is paired one-to-one with the modules they test. For example, the tests
for chattools.mentions are found in tests/test_mentions.py. Attempt to
maintain this organization when adding new tests.

This repository comes with a tox.ini file which is configured to run a fairly
exhaustive set of tests. All the current unit tests run, and pass, under Python
2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 interpreters. Running the default tox command will
attempt to run the tests in all these environments. In addition, tox is also
configured to run PEP8, PyFlakes, and PyLint checks. The PyLint checks will
make use of the .pylintrc file also included in this repository.
